# Negotiation Tips

Yay you got an offer! Now what?

Here are some ethical tips to maximize your offer :)

* **connect to your interviewers over email.** Ideally right after the interview. actually one reached out to me haha. And we had a long conversation. He gave all sorts of insider advice. Adding that personal touch could be the difference between a “yes” and a “no”. Make sure you mention how much you enjoyed their energy. How their questions were interesting and relevant. And how excited you are to join&#x20;
* **make friends with your recruiter**. Really get to know them. Ask about their life. Your recruiter doesn’t decide your salary but will be a key in representing you during the negotiation&#x20;
* this is a **two sided negotiation**. You’re not just “getting a job”. They are “getting an employee”. From start to finish it costs an employer around $30k to interview and close an employee. That’s not including recruiters (which can be 20%-30% of your first year salary). Furthermore it’s still an employee’s market. There is a shortage of talented engineers. If you got to an offer stage it’s unlike they will walk away. They invested a LOT into you.&#x20;
* **have a counteroffer.** Leave your favorite company for the end of the process. You have a lot of leverage with another offer. Probably the best negotiation tip
* you may want to hire a **negotiation coach** from Levels or [interviewing.io ](https://iio.sh/r/dYPO)(they will only charge you if you get a significant bump)
* **never say what you want directly.** Instead say “well Google offered me $x. And I’m also interviewing for Meta who’s targeting me for an ICy. So I’m entertaining offers in $x+$20k - $x-$50k ranges. I still want to do a few more interviews to see where my skillset will get me. But of course TC isn’t everything. I REALLY love your culture and think I’ll be an amazing fit”
* **apply time pressure** “Your company is my favorite, but Google did make a more lucrative offer. I need to give them an answer by Friday. Do you think you can come back with a comparable offer before then?”
* **the company wants you to be happy**: A company doesn’t want to squeeze the smallest salary out of you. You will resent them and quit as soon as you get a better offer. They invested a lot of money in you and want you to be happy and stick around.&#x20;
* **ask for signon bonus**: your salary is a yearly expense, so it has to be accounted for in the budget. A one time bonus is a one time expense. You will usually be able to add another $30,000 or so to your first year salary by asking for a signon bonus. After the first year, you can usually ask for a riase, so it won't be that big a deal
* **ask for different cities**: most companies will have cost of living variations for different cities. NYC and SF are Tier 1 cities and will generally compensate $30k or so more than Tier 2 cities (ex: Miami). But of course be aware of the state tax and cost of living implications.



**Tl;dr**: always have counteroffers. But make sure you let your favorite company that they’re your favorite and that you will be an incredible fit and are super excited.&#x20;
