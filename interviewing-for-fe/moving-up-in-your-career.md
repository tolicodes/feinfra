# Moving Up in Your Career

* Hit up recruiters and go on interviews even if you don’t want the job.
* Go to lots of conferences and hackathons. Never know who you will meet.&#x20;
* Ask all your friends to refer you. That’s the best way to get in.&#x20;
* Sooner or later you’ll get to a nice org.&#x20;
* Once you’re there:
  * Be super social, talk to everyone
  * Do side work for other team.&#x20;
  * Mentor ppl.&#x20;
  * Pair program.&#x20;
