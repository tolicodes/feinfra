Here are some company-specific notes



## Dropbox

#### Remote Work

Dropbox is “virtual first”. You don’t have an assigned office. You can work from anywhere in the US (note it does affect your salary based on city). And I think a few months outside the country (they were vague). There is a list of like 10 countries you can work from permanently, but expect much less $

Dropbox has “Studios” where you can work out of. But they’re nowhere near as nice as pre-COVID offices with free 3 star Michelin food. You may cowork out of studios, or meet with your team occasionally.
