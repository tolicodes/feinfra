# Companies

Here are some company-specific notes. The following notes came from dozens of phone calls with current and former Dropbox employees, Blind, Levels, and other sources.

Note that I chose Dropbox, and am strongly happy with my choice, so I'm obviously biased. But I made sure to keep as objective as possible.

I will slowly fill this page with other companies I interviewed for. Feel free to a submit a PR for yours.

**IMPORTANT**: I am **NOT legally/officially representing** any of these companies or claiming it's valid. It's simply an **aggregation** of what I've seen in **public forums and asking around**. It is meant to give you a rough sketch and opinion of culture within these companies. All information obtained here was **non-proprietary** gathered **BEFORE** employment at these companies, and did not come from an official company source.

## Dropbox

#### Pros

* **WLB**: Dropbox is known for its amazing WLB. Most teams have a very relaxed culture. There are few deadlines and low expectations compared to most startups and even other big tech.&#x20;
* **Cross-Team:** If you so choose, you are empowered to implement new concepts, frameworks, refactors, even though they are not directly the responsibility of your team. As long as other engineers agree with your approach, management won't block you from making such changes. Additionally, if you want to switch teams, it's pretty trivial
* **Little Competition/Politics**: At least as an IC, there is very little politics and competition for positions.
* **Great Comp**: You can expect $300-$500k as a senior engineer at Dropbox and up to $1M as Staff and above. For reference, I stagnated at $180k in startup world, and now make over double that. See [Levels](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Dropbox/salaries/Software-Engineer/) for more details. Comp is fairly accurate from my personal experience. Comp is very much on par with FAANGs.
* **Great engineering culture**: They highly value code quality, collaboration, and keeping up to date with community standards
* **Modern Tech Stack**: React, Redux, Typescript on the FE (and I believe Python, Go, and Rust on the BE). Especially in frontend, Dropbox keeps up with the latest community standards
* **Friendly**: Compared to other companies I interviewed with, Dropbox has very friendly folks. Everyone I spoke to (biased and unbiased) noted the collaborative culture. Colleagues will hang with you outside of work
* **Great for Parents**: Dropbox gives great partenal leave, $25k in adoption assistance, $5k in babysitter credits, fertility assitance. And of course the great WLB.

**Cons**

* **Promotions**: Something mentioned by almost everyone I spoke to, is promotions are quite difficult. So make sure you negotiate as high of a band as you can when entering. With that said, you can get a promotion if you get to know the right people, and highlight your impact on the company. You will have lots of room for side work outside of your team. Volunteer for task and projects that have high visibility and impact.
* **Virtual First (No Office)**: Pre-COVID, Dropbox was know for its amazing office. 5 start Michellin meals, great office culture, a vending machine full on any peripheral you want (headphones, etc). After COVID, Dropbox went "virtual first". Many say this was a cost cutting measure. While many engineers prefer this, some downsides include a less "extroverted" work style. I like to hang with coworkers in the office, have water cooler chats. There are "Studios" aka coworking spaces for teams to occasionally meet. But from what I heard they're not used much.
* **Slow**: Like most big orgs, Dropbox is a bit slow on the product side. Projects take a very long time to complete. Coming from the startup world, this may be a shock.
* **Stagnant Product**: Most of the revenue comes from Dropbox's core business (storage and sync). It has tried spinning off a few products, but they haven't been to successful. Management has been somewhat risk averse in trying products outside the core business. This may affect you if you're startup-minded and product focused. But not as much if you care mostly about the tech
* **Upper Management**: I heard from a few sources, that since one of the founders left, the upper management quality has declined. People mentioened there isn't as much focus on growth anymore, and the company doesn't innovate a lot from the product side. However this doesn't seem to affect ICs much.

#### Verdict

Obviously, I chose Dropbox as my employer, so I'm biased. But I'd say the pros definitely outweight the cons. As someone who in interested in frontend tech infrastructure, this is a great environment to work.

#### Perks

Some of the perks that stood out

* The health care is more or less standard across tech companies. Nothing too special. Anthem PPO 250 or HDPD 2800 ($1400 contributions)
* $6k 401k match
* $7k to spend on whatever “wellness” you want (gym, desk, coffeemaker, you name it)
* 20 vacation days, 11 holiday, 14 Fridays off (gotta confirm how this works)
* $25k per child adoption support
* 4 volunteer days&#x20;
* $2k gift match to nonprofits)
* Free Dropbox Basic for friends
* Nominate a Non Profit for a Dropbox business account

#### Remote Work

Dropbox is “virtual first”. You don’t have an assigned office. You can work from anywhere in the US (note it does affect your salary based on city). And I think a few months outside the country (they were vague). There is a list of like 10 countries you can work from permanently, but expect much less $

Dropbox has “Studios” where you can work out of. But they’re nowhere near as nice as pre-COVID offices with free 3 star Michelin food. You may cowork out of studios, or meet with your team occasionally.

Dropbox has a range of salary bands adjusted for location. If you relocate somewhere permanently, then eventually they'll reassign your salary band accordingly.

You may work anywher in the US, as there are no required in person meetings. Additionally, Dropbox has a list of approved locations in which the company is registered as an employer.&#x20;

This includes:

* Australia
* Canada
* France
* Germany
* Ireland
* Israel
* Japan
* Netherlands
* Singapore
* Sweden
* US
* UK

You are allowed to take short/medium term trips working from elsewhere in the world! Exactly how long you can spend somewhere before you change your residency is probably the fuzzy part. I've gotten various info that the remote work can range 1-3 mo.
