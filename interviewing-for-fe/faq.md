## How long does the process take?

For big tech companies, expect the interview process to take 1-2 mo from recruiter call to signing your offer. The companies move quite slow.

A typical timeline:

* **Phone Interview with Recruiter**: A recruiter will vet you and ask questions to determine you have relevant experience 3-7 days later you'll get a coding exercise or a call with an engineer **\[3-7 days]**
* **Tech Screen / Coding Exercise**: You will either do a interview with an engineer or an independent coding exercise. Afterwards, you will get a decision on whether to proceed in **\[3-7 days]**
* **Onsite:** Depending on the company, it may take 3-14 days to actually schedule your onsite. Expect 1-2 days full of interviews (6-8 hours). Afterwards all the interviews will submit their "signals" (aka evaluations) **\[3-14 days].**&#x20;
* **Offer**: The hiring bar (HB) will meet in 3-7 days (or more) to discuss your performance based on the signals and come to a decision on your leveling **\[3-7 days]**
* **Offer Negotation**: This may take a while. Expect 7-21 days to [negotiate](negotiation-tips.md) your offer. Don't rush this. This takes a while, because the recruiter will have to go back to the HB each time an adjustment has to be made **\[7-21 days]**
