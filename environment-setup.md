# Environment Setup

## Hardware Setup

I am joining Dropbox on the 28th! And moving to NYC. And turning 30 of the 22nd.

So I thought I'd celebrate all this by getting my dream Macbook Setup :) I have some flexible budget from Dropbox, but would like to keep in within reasonable bounds.

Suggestions welcome!

* MACBOOK - Standard issue 64GB 1TB Macbook Pro Max
* DESK: I'd like a big L desk to fit a 49" monitor and a 34" monitor. Found this: [Coleshome 66" L Shaped Gaming Desk, Corner Computer Desk, Sturdy Home Office Computer Table, Writing Desk, Larger Gaming Desk Workstation, Black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XNXJWLC/?coliid=I30COSV9XKATG1\&colid=VRMIVEV0N63G\&psc=1\&ref\_=lv\_ov\_lig\_dp\_it) $150

* MONITOR: I'm a frontend engineer, so generally have VSCode, Browser with Inspector, and all my notification/messaing thingies.
